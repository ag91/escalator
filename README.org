This package allows you to integrate multiple Helm searchers so that
you can switch between searches.

You can install this file by loading it by hand or, if you use
=use-package= adding the file in "~/.emacs.d/lisp" and using this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package escalator
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp"
  :after helm)
#+end_src


You will need helm and the helm searchers mentioned in your
=escalator-commands-map=, the custom variable that sets the available
searchers and their order.
